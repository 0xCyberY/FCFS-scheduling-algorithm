Step 1: Start the program
Step 2: Accept the number of processes in the ready queue
Step 3: For each process in the ready queue, assign the process id and accept the CPU burst time
Step 4: Set the waiting of the first process as ‘0’ and its burst time as its turnaround time
Step 5: For each process in the Ready queue calculate
(i) Waiting time for process(n)= Waiting time of process (n-1) + Burst time of process(n-1)
(ii) Turnaround time for Process(n)= Waiting time of Process(n)+ Burst time for process(n)
Step 6: Calculate
(iii) Average waiting time = Total Waiting Time / Number of process
(iv) Average Turnaround time = Total Turnaround Time / Number of process
Step 7: Stop the program
